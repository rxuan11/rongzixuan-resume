        <p class="lead mb-4">Club activity planner- When I first entered high school, one of the communities on campus that immediately made me feel at home was the Chinese student association club. The upperclassmen in the club took me in and were the first to offer me a helping hand in an unfamiliar place. Years later, when I earned the role of club secretary, I was glad to take on the responsibilities of handling club communications and organizing school events, even though my predecessors had warned me of how hard it would be to balance the work with my academics. To me, the role meant more than a responsibility. It was an opportunity for me to offer my own helping hand to new members, having been in their shoes and understanding their struggles better than anyone else. Rather than bemoaning the work of preparing for events, I was ecstatic with the idea that the booth I had put hours into setting up could potentially introduce a new member to the clubâ€™s family. Building these personal relationships and helping my peers succeed became such a large passion for me that it didnâ€™t matter how much work I had to put in â€“ it was always worth it.During my last year in the position, I began to look back on all the work that I had done, wondering if it was enough. Most of my work as secretary was regulatory and procedural, but I wanted to do more than just maintain the club. It didnâ€™t feel like enough to just do the same things my predecessors had done. I wanted to do better. With this philosophy, I spent the year doing what I did best: reaching out to students and club members and encouraging them to reach their full potential, whether it was helping a confused-looking student find their classroom or spending after school hours helping a peer work on their English. As someone who joined the club for its people, my legacy will be the new members of the clubâ€™s family, whom I know will do even better.
